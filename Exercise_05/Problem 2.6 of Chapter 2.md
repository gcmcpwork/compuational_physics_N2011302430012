##Abstract
  Using Euler method with Python, solve the problem 2.6 of chapter 2.
<br/><br/>

##Introduction
###Problem 2.6
  Using method Euler to calculate the trajectory of projectile motion, ignoring the influence of air resistance and air density.<br/>

###The Euler Method
The principle of the Euler method is Taylor expansion. And the routine process is to substitute the given ordinary differential equation into the first-order derivative of the Taylor expansion and neglect infinitesimals of hiher order.
